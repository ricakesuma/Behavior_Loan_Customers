# Analyzing Loan Customers

I conducted an analysis of the behavior and customer profiles at a bank that offers a loan program for property purchases. In this analysis, I will discuss several important aspects related to customer behavior and their profiles. To begin with, it is crucial to understand customer behavior within the context of property loans. I collected data on customers' loan history, including loan status, loan durations, and repayment success rates. This information helps to comprehend customers' payment patterns and predict potential credit risks. Additionally, I analyzed customers' demographic profiles, such as status, income, and occupation. This data is essential as it provides insights into customers' ability to repay loans and their financial risk. For instance, customers with higher incomes may have a better capacity to repay loans compared to those with lower incomes.
